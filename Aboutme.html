    <h1>About Me</h1
  <p>I’m working to become financially stable, so I won't have to worry about working my entire life. My experiences are the hardships I had to endure to get to where I am today. I’ll be working toward these goals by staying on track a eliminating any unnecessary distractions. I  will also set certain rules that will keep me in check. Important values for my success would include my Family. My family will motivate me and make me want to work harder towards my future. My short-term goal is to get financially stable enough that I can at least help my family with payments and debts. The traits and achievements I want to be known for are that I am a hard worker and a good leader that everyone can look up to whenever they need help with something. These traits and achievements will show people that I care about my career.</p>
